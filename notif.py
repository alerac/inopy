	This code uses the pydbus library to send notifications. It defines a function send_notification() that takes summary and body as parameters. 

	Then, it calls the Notify method to send a notification with the specified parameters.

	Note that this code assumes that the necessary dependencies are installed and that the D-Bus service for notifications is available on the system.
