	This code uses the values from the configuration file to construct a request payload. 

	The refresh function sends a POST request to the Inoreader OAuth endpoint <https://www.inoreader.com/developers/oauth> using the payload and headers to handle the refresh token process.

	Then it extracts the refreshed bearer token and the new refresh token in order to use it in the replace() function of the main ino.py module.
