	The aim of this module is to refresh both OAuth 2.0 access and refresh tokens and update the configuration file with the refreshed tokens.

'''
=====================================================
	Create a refresh function to refresh the bearer
	and refresh token in the config data

	*	Set the headers and prepare the payload
		data for the HTTP request

	*	Send a POST request to the specified
		endpoint with the payload and headers
	
	*	Check the response status code to determine
		if the request was successful
	
	*	Parse the response data as JSON and extract
		the refreshed bearer token and new refresh
		token from the response data
	
	*	Open the config file. Load the existing
		config data from the file and update the
		bearer token and refresh token in the config
		data
	
	*	Move the file pointer to the beginning of
		the file, write the updated config data back
		to the file, overwriting the existing content
	
	*	Truncate the file to remove any remaining
		content after the updated data
