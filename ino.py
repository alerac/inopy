	Inopy retrieves unread articles from the Inoreader API <https://www.inoreader.com/developers> and sends a notification if there are any unread articles.

	It uses a config file to store OAuth authentication data, Inoreader API endpoints <https://www.inoreader.com/developers/api-endpoint> and notification data.

	It performs token refreshing process if the API request returns an unauthorized status code.

	Inopy is structured into functions and modules for making API requests, parsing response data, refreshing tokens, sending notifications and logging the processes.

	For more information about OAuth authentication, plase see <https://www.inoreader.com/developers/oauth>
